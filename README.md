# Ticket Booking Service

The Ticket Booking Service is a command line application that enables an attendant at a service station to create an upcoming event and generate tickets for people planning to attend the event. 

## Main Features

The application allows the user, in this case the attendant, to:

	1.	create a new event by adding the following details:
		•	Event name
		•	Event start date
		•	Event end date
		•	Event venue
	2.	view a list of all upcoming events
	3.	delete an event
	4.	edit the details of an event
	5.	generate tickets for an upcoming event and send the tickets to the customer's e-mail address
	6.	view all tickets generated for a particular event
	7.	invalidate any ticket in the list of generated tickets

After generating a ticket and sending it to an e-mail address, the application also sends weekly reminders about the event to that e-mail address, up until the day of the event.
